 *
 * Given a list of numbers (possibly including duplicates) and a positive integer k, find the minimum and maximum possible product of k elements taken from the list.
 *
 * If you cannot take enough elements from the list (k > list size), return None/nil
 *
 * Examples
 * numbers = [1, -2, -3, 4, 6, 7]
 *
 * k = 1  ==>  -3, 7
 * k = 2  ==>  -21, 42    # -3*7, 6*7
 * k = 3  ==>  -126, 168  # -3*6*7, 4*6*7
 * k = 7  ==>  None       # there are only 6 elements in the list
 * Note: the test lists are sufficiently small (up to 20 elements) for a simple approach.
 *
 * There is an advanced version of this kata, if you're up to the challenge! :-)
